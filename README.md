This repository is created  for so many reasons, here are the main reasons:
1- to gather  basics of javascript with comments and note for more understanding the logic behind each line of code to get back to it whenever neeeded
2- to be a cheatsheet for new JS learners.
3- to be able to explain basics in my own words
